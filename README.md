# Fake-vs-Real-Image-Detection-Challenge.
Using the concepts thought in class we are told to accurately distinguish the fake image from the real image. So basically built a cnn model which contails maxpooling2d , 
dropout, filters and some dense layers with appropiate activation functions. Then hypertunned my model to find the right learning rate. Applied transfer learning by call
mobile net artitexcture and called the model. In leaderboard secured a score of 0.61 accuracy and rank of 4th in class. Things that could have improved the score by image 
data generator and getting more data from gans model.
